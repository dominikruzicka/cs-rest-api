 - !!! Make SendersService return Senders names not only accounts, will be need to store account+name MAP in AccountsResource !!!
 - !!! Create unit tests !!!

- Better error handling when calling and receiving responses from CS

- If I have time: Search more on and maybe rewrite in AccountsResource call to CS API to java.net.http.* (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MmlRZZxTqk)

- If I have time: AccountsService -> think of simplifying code in getTransactionSenderSet and getAccountsList
